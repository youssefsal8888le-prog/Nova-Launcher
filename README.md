## Introduction

* Nova Launcher is a Minecraft: Java Edition launcher for Android and iOS based on [Boardwalk](https://github.com/zhuowei/Boardwalk)
* This launcher can launch almost all available Minecraft versions ranging from rd-132211 to 1.21 snapshots (including Combat Test versions)
* Modding via Forge and Fabric are also supported.
* This repository contains source code for Android. For iOS/iPadOS, check out [Nova Launcher_iOS](https://github.com/Nova LauncherTeam/Nova Launcher_iOS).

## Getting Nova Launcher

You can get Nova Launcher via three methods:

1. **Releases:** Download the prebuilt app from our [stable releases](https://github.com/Nova LauncherTeam/Nova Launcher/releases) or [automatic builds](https://github.com/Nova LauncherTeam/Nova Launcher/actions).
2. **Google Play:** Get it from Google Play by clicking on this badge: [![Google Play](https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/static/images/badges/en_badge_web_generic.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.kdt.novalaunch)
3. **Build from Source:** Follow the [building instructions](#building) below.

## Building

### Quick Build (Recommended)

The easiest way to build Nova Launcher is to use the pre-built JREs provided by our CI.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Nova LauncherTeam/Nova Launcher.git`
2. Build the launcher: `./gradlew :app_novalauncher:assembleDebug` (Use `gradlew.bat` on Windows)

The built APK will be located in `app_novalauncher/build/outputs/apk/debug/`.

### Detailed Build

If you need more control over the build process, follow these steps:

1. **Java Runtime Environment (JRE):** Download the `jre8-pojav` artifact from our [CI auto builds](https://github.com/Nova LauncherTeam/android-openjdk-build-multiarch/actions).  This package contains pre-built JREs for all supported architectures.  If you need to build the JRE yourself, follow the instructions in the [android-openjdk-build-multiarch](https://github.com/Nova LauncherTeam/android-openjdk-build-multiarch) repository.

2. **LWJGL:** The build instructions for the custom LWJGL are available over the [LWJGL repository](https://github.com/Nova LauncherTeam/lwjgl3).

3. **Language List:** Because languages are auto-added by Crowdin, you need to run the language list generator before building. In the project directory, run:
   * Linux/macOS:
     ```bash
     chmod +x scripts/languagelist_updater.sh
     bash scripts/languagelist_updater.sh
     ```
   * Windows:
     ```batch
     scripts\languagelist_updater.bat
     ```

4. **Build GLFW stub:** `./gradlew :jre_lwjgl3glfw:build`

5. **Build the launcher:** `./gradlew :app_novalauncher:assembleDebug` (Replace `gradlew` with `gradlew.bat` on Windows).
